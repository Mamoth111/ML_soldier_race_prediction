# Soldier Race Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict the race of soldiers in the US Army based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about soldiers including their age, education, etc., as well as their race. The dataset is available in the file `soldier_race_data.csv`.

## Files
- Raw data taken from web then combined, 'edited.csv' is the data to use for notebook from 'Copy and Save data after EDA' part in notebook.
- `Soldier_Race_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier analysis, visualization, and building machine learning models.

## Data Analysis
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
- Outlier analysis is conducted to identify and handle outliers in the data.

## Machine Learning Models
- Machine learning models are built using various classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the performance of the models.

## Results
- The performance of the machine learning models is evaluated using appropriate classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
- The predictions of the models are compared with actual soldier races to assess their effectiveness.
